This website is adapted from [Francisco Villamil's personal website](https://franvillamil.github.io/), originally developed using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Building on the code snipets found originally found in his [repository](https://github.com/franvillamil/franvillamil.github.io), minor changes to the original aesthetic and content have been made in order to tailor it to my own profile. All credit for the original structure and styling goes to [Francisco Villamil's personal website]([https://franvillamil.github.io/](https://github.com/franvillamil)).
