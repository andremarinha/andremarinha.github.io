## Welcome!

![](images/IMG_5030.jpg)

I am a PhD student at the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/it/persona/andre-queiroz-candido-de-carvalho-marinha). My ongoing doctoral research focuses on social cleavages and political behaviour in Southern Europe. On a parallel endeavour, I have also been working on topics of political representation and constituency service in Sub-Saharan Africa as a researcher at [HOME - How Members of Parliament in Africa Represent Their Constituencies](https://project-home.pt/).

My research interests lie at the intersection between sociology, political and social psychology (e.g., social identity theory and social representations theory), and comparative politics. Over the last years, I became interested in developing and implementing mixed-methods and multi-modal research designs to study how ordinary citizens make sense of politics and how it informs their political behaviour.

I hold a MSc in Sociology from ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon, a Post-graduation in Social Research Methods from ICS - Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon, and a BA in Political Science and International Relations from NOVA University of Lisbon. In 2023, I was a Visiting Research Fellow at the [Department of Portuguese and Brazilian Studies](https://portuguese-brazilian.brown.edu/) at Brown University.

If any of this is of interest to you or think that we share similar interests, please feel free to reach out at [andre.marinha\@sns.it](mailto:andre.marinha@sns.it)
